Hello World!

I recently picked up the base set for Star Wars Legion, which includes both Stormtroopers and Rebels. I decided to start by painting the Stormtroopers, since I figured they would be a bit easier to get the hang of.

The first thing I did was give the figures a light gray primer. This helps the paint to adhere better and provides a neutral base for the rest of the colors. Next, I used a gray wash to fill in the lower parts of the figures with a darker shade of gray. This helps to create depth and shadow on the miniature.

After the wash had dried, I did a white dry brush over the top of the figure. This technique involves lightly dragging a brush loaded with white paint over the surface of the miniature, which helps to create highlights and give the armor a more realistic, metallic appearance.

Once the dry brushing was complete, I moved on to painting the under suit and the black details, such as the visors and pauldron. It was a bit of a challenge to get the details just right, but I'm pretty happy with how they turned out.

Overall, I had a lot of fun painting these Stormtrooper miniatures, and I'm looking forward to tackling the Rebels next. I'll be sure to share my progress with all of you!
