Hi,

In this post i share 3D projects i have worked on. Feel free to look around.

This is a trailer of a VR game i have worked on called Grutte Pier VR at the company VRRoom. It was a short VR game where you defend a Frisian village from Dutch soldiers in the time of Grutte Pier. I worked as a 3D artist intern while making this game. I also worked in Unity to create the scene you see in the trailer.
